/**
 * Mid-Season Team Release API
 * 
 * Purpose: When a team leaves/drops out mid-season, this releases ALL their players
 * (both SS Members and Football Players) immediately so they can be used in auctions.
 * 
 * Example:
 * - Team Azzuri FC leaves during S17
 * - All their SS Members → released to free agent pool
 * - All their Football Players → released to auction pool
 * - Contract end dates are updated to current season
 * 
 * This is different from contract reconciliation which happens at season transitions.
